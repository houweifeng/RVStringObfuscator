Automated string obfuscation. Sample written for my iOS security related articles on my [blog](http://robertvojta.pro/).

* `source` - command line utility for obfuscation
* `sample` - sample project with automated obfuscation

**Sample**

How to integrate it in your application.

Create strings file. Simple text file, UTF-8 encoding, one string per line. Check [sample.txt](https://github.com/robertvojta/RVStringObfuscator/blob/master/sample/StringObfuscatorSample/sample.txt). This file is included in project file to have it accessible and editable in Xcode, but it's **not** included in any target.
